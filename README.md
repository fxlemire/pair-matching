Pair-Matching
=============
This is a simple and easy-to-customize program which allows to match people in pairs.

A good use would be for Secret Santa.

Enter the people you need to match together, and this program will send an e-mail to all participants telling them who is their pick.

There is no interface yet, you need to hardcode your e-mail, people and matching conditions manually.
